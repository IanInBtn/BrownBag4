This is the repo for Brown Bag #4 (Hands on TDD)


The "leapyears" and "leapyears.test" projects contain the code for "Guided Kata" which was demo'd in Part-1. 

The "bowlinggame" and "tictactoe" projects are for the Hands-On Katas in Part-2.

There are starter branches to do any Kata for yourself, as well as branches for the completed Katas.


### The Leap Year rules

A leap year is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.


### The TicTacToe rules

This is just a 3x3 game of noughts and crosses. 

Players just take turns to complete a line of 3 "X"s or "O"s.


### The Bowling Game rules

The game consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player has
two opportunities to knock down 10 pins.  The score for the frame is the total
number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The bonus for
that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll. So in frame 3
above, the score is 10 (the total number knocked down) plus a bonus of 5 (the
number of pins knocked down on the next roll.)

A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try. The bonus
for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
balls to complete the frame. However no more than three balls can be rolled in
tenth frame.
