This is the repo for Brown Bag #4 (Hands on TDD)


The "leapyears" and "leapyears.test" projects contain the code for "Guided Kata" which was demo'd in Part-1. 

The "bowlinggame" and "tictactoe" projects are for the Hands-On Katas in Part-2.

There are starter branches to do any Kata for yourself, as well as branches for the completed Katas.


### The TicTacToe rules

This is just a 3x3 game of noughts and crosses. 

Players just take turns to complete a line of 3 "X"s or "O"s.

#### Goal of the Kata is a method that returns:-

0 if the board is not yet finished (there are empty spots & no win or draw),

1 if "X" won,

2 if "O" won,

3 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw)

#### Try alternative setups & solutions

Choose different board implementations,

a 9-char string

a 3x3 array

Add validation on moves i.e. ensure square not taken

Change starting “O” or “X” & validate whose move it is
